# binary-pks

These are binary packages that we host in order to ensure a consistent environment.
Otherwise source distributions get built each time with potentially different tools / libraries.
The files are [hosted here](http://actioniq-oss.github.io/binary-pkgs/) by GitHub Pages.

If you add/edit any packages here you should run `./rebuild-index.sh` to update the `index.html` file.
